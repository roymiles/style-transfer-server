# StyleTransfer

This was a short project for the Imperial Lates Programm ([here](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/be-inspired/lates/)), where I developed and showcased a live interactive demo using Neural Style Transfer.
The public audience was able to upload and style their own images, while enabling discussions about the current state of research in computer vision and deep learning.
